<h3>Natural Language Processing</h3>
My primary project is the <a href="https://github.com/cltk/cltk">Classical Language Toolkit</a> (CLTK), a framework for natural language processing (NLP) for the languages of Ancient, Classical, and Medieval Eurasia. I am responsible for the project's oversight, as well as editing the libraries for Ancient Greek and Latin. <a href="https://github.com/kylepjohnson/notebooks/tree/master/public_talks">See here for materials</a> from my public talks on the CLTK.

For the Pema Ts'al Orthographic System (for which I am the lead developer) I have customized <a href="https://github.com/kylepjohnson/pema_tsal_fonts">fonts</a> and <a href="https://github.com/kylepjohnson/pema_tsal_tibetan_keyboard">a keyboard</a> which introduce several new punctuation characters to Tibetan orthography, in order to aid beginners in reading the language.

<h3>Scholarship</h3>
While in academia, I published a few articles and wrote a dissertation. Of my publications, several of the more interesting are one on <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=fyUJoZ8oPVEC&lpg=PT51&ots=HfqEkxO9MD&dq=comics%20classics%20kyle%20johnson&pg=PT51#v=onepage&q=comics%20classics%20kyle%20johnson&f=false">what comics have to offer the study of literature</a> (from Oxford University Press) and <a href="http://ancientstudies.fas.nyu.edu/docs/CP/963/EtruscanNews05.pdf">a short piece on Etruscan medicine</a>, which to my utter surprise took on a life of its own as a foundation for contemporary pharmaceutical research. <a href="https://github.com/kylepjohnson/NYU-Dissertation-in-Classics/blob/master/20120825-dissertation.pdf?raw=true">My dissertation</a> is a network-theoretical study of Julius Caesar's organization and leadership of the Roman army.
