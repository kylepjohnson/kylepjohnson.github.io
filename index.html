<h3>Natural Language Processing</h3>
My primary project is the <a href="https://github.com/cltk/cltk">Classical Language Toolkit</a> (CLTK), a decentralized platform for natural language processing (NLP) for the languages of Ancient, Classical, and Medieval Eurasia. I am largely responsible for the project's organization of developers and the quality of its NLP. <a href="https://github.com/kylepjohnson/notebooks/tree/master/public_talks">See here for materials</a> from my public talks on the CLTK.

<h3>Research</h3>
Outside of work, most of my academic research has involved lecturing and writing about NLP and philology. In particular, I advocate for the vital importance of free and open, decentralized platforms for the research into an interconnected ancient world. While in academia, I published a few articles and wrote a dissertation. <a href="https://github.com/kylepjohnson/NYU-Dissertation-in-Classics/blob/master/20120825-dissertation.pdf?raw=true">My dissertation</a> is a network-theoretical study of Julius Caesar's organization and leadership of the Roman army. Of my publications, two of the more interesting are one on <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=fyUJoZ8oPVEC&lpg=PT51&ots=HfqEkxO9MD&dq=comics%20classics%20kyle%20johnson&pg=PT51#v=onepage&q=comics%20classics%20kyle%20johnson&f=false">what comic book art has to offer the study of literature</a> (from Oxford University Press) and <a href="http://www.umass.edu/etruscannews/articles/EtruscanNews05.pdf">a short piece on Etruscan medicine</a>, which to my utter surprise took on a life of its own as a foundation for contemporary pharmaceutical research (<a href="https://curis.ku.dk/ws/files/9129811/AJPT_06.pdf">example</a>).

For the Pema Ts'al Orthographic System (for which I am the lead developer) I have customized <a href="https://github.com/kylepjohnson/pema_tsal_fonts">fonts</a> and <a href="https://github.com/kylepjohnson/pema_tsal_tibetan_keyboard">a keyboard</a> which introduce several new punctuation characters to Tibetan orthography, in order to aid beginners in reading the language.
