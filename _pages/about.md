I am a research scientist in the domain of NLP (natural language processing). In recent years, my professional work has centered around AI strategy and zero-to-one product development.

The chief aim of my academic work has been to make state-of-the-art NLP tooling accessible to scholars of the Ancient, Classical, and Medieval worlds. The [Classical Language Toolkit](https://github.com/cltk/cltk) (CLTK) is an NLP framework for pre-modern languages. I referee for conferences frequently, lecture occasionally ([slides in blog](/blog)), and [publish](/publications) rarely.

 <!-- My formal education was in Classics (BA, Reed College; PhD, NYU). -->

<!-- I born and raised in the State of Washington, and now reside in the Bay Area. -->

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
