I am a humanist and technologist with specialization in the AI subdomain of NLP (natural language processing).

My recent professional work has centered around AI strategy and zero-to-one product development. Outside of industry, my research revolves around the [Classical Language Toolkit](https://github.com/cltk/cltk) (CLTK), which brings state-of-the-art NLP to scholars of the ancient world.

I referee for conferences frequently, lecture occasionally ([slides in blog](/blog)), and [publish](/publications) rarely.
