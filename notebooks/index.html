  <h2>Notebooks</h2>

<em>My notebooks are now hosted at <a href="https://github.com/kylepjohnson/ipython">github.com/kylepjohnson/ipython</a>. The following will be kept here a short while longer.</em>

<ul>
    <li>
      <h3><a href="10,000 most common Greek words.html">10,000 most common Greek words</a></h3>An example use of `Counter().most_common()` to find most frequently used words (non-stemmed) in the TLG.
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3><a href="10,000 most common Latin words.html">10,000 most common Latin words</a></h3>10,000 most common Latin words</h3>An example use of `Counter().most_common()` to find most frequently used words (non-stemmed) in the PHI5.
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3><a href="Cross-validation of the CLTK's POS taggers, Latin.html">Cross-validation of the CLTK's Latin POS taggers, Latin</a></h3>Cross–validates the accuracy of the CLTK's taggers, giving mean and standard deviation of each. This is a good check of the tagger's accuracy and demonstrates that the models are not overfit to the data.
    </li>

      <h3><a href="Lexical diversity in the Greek canon.html">Lexical diversity in the Greek canon</a></h3>The lexical diversity of all authors in the TLG.
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3><a href="Lexical diversity in the Latin canon.html">Lexical diversity in the Latin canon</a></h3>The lexical diversity of all authors in the PHI5.
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3><a href="/notebooks/Tf-idf pairwise similarity, Latin.html">Tf-idf pairwise similarity, Latin</a></h3>Generates a 131,044-line file of the scores of all PHI5 Latin authors' tf-idf similarity to one another. <a href="/blog/2015/02/01/tf-idf-pairwise-similarity-latin-cannon.html">Explanatory blog post here</a>.

      <h3><a href="/notebooks/Tf-idf pairwise similarity, Greek.html">Tf-idf pairwise similarity, Greek</a></h3>Generates a 3,157,729-line file of the scores of all TLG authors' tf-idf similarity to one another. <a href="/blog/2015/04/02/tf-idf-pairwise-similiarity-greek-canon.html">Explanatory blog post here</a>.

      <h3><a href="Greek authors' average words per sentence.html">Greek authors' average words per sentence</a></h3>This explores from a very high level some averages of words per sentence in all of Ancient Greek literature and within several genres (e.g., history, romance, philosophy, epic, tragedy, comedy). This may not seem like much, though to my knowledge this is the first survey of its kind.
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3><a href="Latin authors' average words per sentence.html">Latin authors' average words per sentence</a></h3>This notebook follows from "Greek authors' average words per sentence", looking instead at the PHI5 corpus in the Latin language. It offers basic table views sorted by words per sentence, total sentences, and total words. I also include a view limited to Roman historians.
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3><a href="Unigram tagging of Greek and Latin with the CLTK.html">Unigram tagging of Greek and Latin with the CLTK</a></h3>A quick overview of part–of–speech (POS) tagging using the NLTK's Unigram machine learning algorithms combined with the CLTK's POS training set. Accuracies are evaluated, too.
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3><a href="Bigram tagging of Greek and Latin with the CLTK.html">Bigram tagging of Greek and Latin with the CLTK</a></h3>A quick overview of part–of–speech (POS) tagging using the NLTK's Bigram machine learning algorithms combined with the CLTK's POS training set. Accuracies are evaluated, too.
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3><a href="Trigram tagging of Greek and Latin with the CLTK.html">Trigram tagging of Greek and Latin with the CLTK</a></h3>A quick overview of part–of–speech (POS) tagging using the NLTK's Trigram machine learning algorithms combined with the CLTK's POS training set. Accuracies are evaluated, too.
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3><a href="N-gram backoff tagging, Greek.html">N-gram backoff tagging, Greek</a></h3>Demonstrates the excellent results (97% accuracy) of combining a unigram, bigram, and trigram together in a backoff chain for Ancient Greek.
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3><a href="N-gram backoff tagging, Latin.html">N-gram backoff tagging, Latin</a></h3>Demonstrates the excellent results (98% accuracy) of combining a unigram, bigram, and trigram together in a backoff chain for Classical Latin.
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3><a href="TnT tagging, Greek.html">TnT tagging, Greek</a></h3>Demonstrates use of a TnT tagger for Greek. The `evaluate()` function does not finish after many hours of computing (on my machine, at least), though it does work. See example of it in action.
    </li>
