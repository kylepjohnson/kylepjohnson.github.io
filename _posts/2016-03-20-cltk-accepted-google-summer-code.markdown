A few weeks back the Classical Language Toolkit was accepted to Google Summer of Code. Needless to say this is terrific news for the project! Here's [the organization's official announcement](http://cltk.org/blog/2016/02/29/cltk-participating-google-summer-code.html).

Since the announcement, while we've been in the student application period, interest in the project has skyrocketed, already with dozens of commits and hundreds of emails. The CLTK website, led by Luke Hollis, has seen tremendous growth already after only these two weeks. As of this moment, our stars on GitHub have doubled, watchers tripled, and – most importantly IMO – six times the forks!

There's been a bit of publicity about our funding opportunities in the Classics world. Among this has been an interview of me and Luke in the newsletter of Harvard's Center for Hellenic Studies, ["Q&A with Kyle P. Johnson and Luke Hollis of the Classical Language Toolkit"](http://kleos.chs.harvard.edu/?p=5836).

Much more to come!
