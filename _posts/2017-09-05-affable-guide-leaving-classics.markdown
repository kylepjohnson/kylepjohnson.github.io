Off and on, over the past year, I have been slowly working on this essay, <a target="_blank" href="/assets/kyle-johnson-affable-guide-leaving-classics.pdf">"An Affable Guide to Leaving Classics"</a>, which records my thoughts about how to move out of Classics and succeed in the nonâ€“academic marketplace.

I'd like to thank my friends who have read it for me and provided valuable feedback.

While I do not plan on keeping this up-to-date, if you have feedback for me, I would appreciate hearing your thoughts.
