Hi, everybody!

Dr. Kyle here. Thanks for finding your way to my virtual walk-in clinic.

I don't have much to say at the moment, but until I do, here's a little bit about the software behind this site: I built it with <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, a Ruby framework for static websites, and deployed it with <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>. The source itself is <a href="https://github.com/kylepjohnson/kylepjohnson.github.io">on GitHub</a>.
